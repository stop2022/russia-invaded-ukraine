A Russian missile hit my family house near Irpin. It could have been worse, much worse, considering that there are dead bodies on the streets all around, but I still can’t believe there are pieces of Russian weapons in our yard.

Ukrainian ballistic missiles killed at least 25 civilians in [#Donetsk](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Donetsk?src=hashtag_click), more hundrers injured, many of them are childrens. That is news of the day, but not for BBC, CNN and western media. New war crimes in [#Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hashtag_click) . Whichever side you are on, this is just horrifying.

A school in Mykolaiv region. There were [#CovilianCasualties](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovilianCasualties?src=hashtag_click) here. And military too. [@Microsoft](https://twitter.com/Microsoft)[@Oracle](https://twitter.com/Oracle)[@SAP](https://twitter.com/SAP)

 you are known for educational projects and supporting schools, and yet you continue operations in [#Russia](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hashtag_click), which destroys schools. Where is the logic?

Shelled residential building in [#Chernihiv](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Chernihiv?src=hashtag_click). Same story in [#Kharkiv](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kharkiv?src=hashtag_click). EvAcuation train from [#Donetsk](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Donetsk?src=hashtag_click) region also shot at. And rockets hit Ivano-Frankie’s airport. Just a couple of hours of sleep and all this happens

Doctors dig mass graves in besieged [#Mariupol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mariupol?src=hashtag_click). 1582 Ukrainians killed in 12 days. Even if they could access graveyards, there wouldn’t be space. [#NoFlyZoneOverUkraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoFlyZoneOverUkraine?src=hashtag_click)

[#Byshov](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Byshov?src=hashtag_click) village. These last 2 weeks my route to and from [#Kyiv](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kyiv?src=hashtag_click) lay through this quiet place, I didn’t even know existed before the war. Destroyed by air strike and villagers shot by soldiers. Why? There’s nothing there, but a detour to Kyiv

Psychiatric hospital [#Kharkiv](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Kharkiv?src=hashtag_click). Are mental health patients also Nazis in Putin’s eyes? [#Russia](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hashtag_click) targets the most vulnerable of the vulnerable. [#Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hashtag_click) struggles to protect all.

[#Mariupol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mariupol?src=hashtag_click) and those are not the worst pictures. Damage all around. 300 [#CivilianCasualties](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CivilianCasualties?src=hashtag_click) so far. [#Russia](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Russia?src=hashtag_click) targets hospitals. Mariupol is critical to NOT allow corridor for Russian troops from Crimea to East Ukraine.
