A Russian missile hit my family house near Irpin. It could have been worse, much worse, considering that there are dead bodies on the streets all around, but I still can’t believe there are pieces of Russian weapons in our yard.

Ukrainian ballistic missiles killed at least 25 civilians in [#Donetsk](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Donetsk?src=hashtag_click), more hundrers injured, many of them are childrens. That is news of the day, but not for BBC, CNN and western media. New war crimes in [#Ukraine](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hashtag_click) . Whichever side you are on, this is just horrifying.
