Throughout the day, Russian troops indiscriminately shelled residential areas of Kharkiv. Tried to document as many Russian war crimes as possible. This video is from what used to be a high tech BMW dealer shop. Now it is Ukrainian forefront position to the north of Kharkiv.

And now it's someone I've known for 16 years and worked with at several independent outlets. Oksana Baulina, a Russian journalist with phenomenal sense of moral clarity, killed by Russian rocket fire on a reporting mission in Kyiv today. I'm yet to process this.

This is Nina.  She is a professional pharmacist from Kharkiv. Before the Russian bombing attack she served in the “9.1.1.” drugstore.  Nina agreed to show the face after the meeting with simple Russians. To make the world know the truth.  She will need a very long treatment.
